# `mini findings`

> The durable store of **review findings** (`.mini/findings/`) — from both the
> adversarial red-team and the human verify review. Decoupled from the run
> report, versioned with the code, so a finding survives the phase it was found
> in and can feed later work.

> **Console-only.** There is **no** `/mini:findings` slash variant. `add` is
> normally called by the [adversarial review](adversarial.md) and
> [verify](verify.md) steps themselves; `list` is for you, in a terminal.

## Synopsis

```bash
mini findings add --severity <blocker|should-know|nit> --title "<headline>" \
  [--source <adversarial|verify>] [--where "<file:line>"] [--body "<what breaks and how>"]

mini findings list            # open findings across all phases
mini findings list --all      # include resolved ones too

mini findings resolve <id...> # close one or more findings (e.g. 160-1 160-2)
mini findings reopen  <id...> # flip them back to open
```

## Description

The review steps used to write their findings with an editor straight into the
**run report of the phase under review**. Once that phase closed, nobody opened
the report again — the finding was buried, and a corrupt or missing report
dropped it silently. `mini findings` fixes that: each finding goes into its own
durable file under `.mini/findings/`, carries an `open`/`resolved` status and a
`source` tag, and is listed across phases so later phases can pick up what is
still open.

- **`add`** records one finding **about the phase under review** — mini infers the
  origin phase (the current one, else the last closed one); you never pass it.
  `--source` tags which review step found it (`adversarial` | `verify`, default
  `adversarial`). It prints the assigned id and the file path, so a failed call is
  visible rather than silently swallowed. This is the *only* write a reviewer
  makes — it reports, it does not edit code.
- **`list`** prints the open findings across all phases (id, severity, source,
  location, title). `--all` includes resolved ones. An empty or missing store
  prints a friendly note and never errors.
- **`resolve <id...>`** closes one or more findings manually — for a finding a
  multi-fix phase addressed, or a `nit` you decide to dismiss. **`reopen <id...>`**
  flips resolved findings back to `open`. Both take several ids, report one line
  per id, and are **idempotent**: an id already in the target state is a benign
  no-op, not an error. An unknown or malformed id is reported and makes the call
  exit non-zero, but the other ids in the batch are still processed.

Findings live in `.mini/findings/phase-{id}.md`, one file per origin phase, each
holding one or more entries:

```
## 155-1 · should-know · open
**Where:** src/foo.ts:42
**Reviewed-at:** 1a2b3c4…
**Source:** adversarial
Null cascades silently on empty input.

The parser returns undefined and the caller crashes two layers up.
```

The `## <id> · <severity> · <status>` header line is the machine-readable
contract — don't hand-edit it. The optional `**Where:**`, `**Reviewed-at:**` and
`**Source:**` lines sit directly under it; each may be absent (older files predate
`**Reviewed-at:**`/`**Source:**`, and reviews outside git omit the SHA). A missing
`**Source:**` defaults to `adversarial`.

## Options

| Flag | For | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--severity <level>` | `add` | `blocker` \| `should-know` \| `nit` (required). |
| `--source <step>` | `add` | `adversarial` \| `verify` — which review found it. Defaults to `adversarial`. |
| `--title <text>` | `add` | Short headline of the finding (required). |
| `--where <loc>` | `add` | Optional location, `file:line`. |
| `--body <text>` | `add` | Optional longer body — what breaks and how. |
| `--all` | `list` | Include resolved findings, not just the open ones. |

`resolve` and `reopen` take finding ids as positional arguments (one or more),
not flags: `mini findings resolve 160-1 160-2`.

## Examples

```bash
$ mini findings add --severity should-know --title "Null cascades" \
    --where "src/parser.ts:42" --body "empty input returns undefined, caller crashes later"
[ok] Finding 155-1 recorded [should-know] → .mini/findings/phase-155.md

$ mini findings list
Open findings
  155-1 [should-know] adversarial src/parser.ts:42 @1a2b3c4 — Null cascades

$ mini findings resolve 155-1
[ok] Finding 155-1 resolved.

$ mini findings resolve 155-1        # idempotent — already in that state
Finding 155-1 is already resolved.

$ mini findings reopen 155-9         # unknown id → reported, exit 1
[x] No such finding: 155-9
```

## Notes

- **Findings are versioned** (committed), like `.mini/decisions/` and
  `.mini/memory/` — durability across sessions is the point. They are **not** in
  `.mini/.gitignore` (unlike the generated `.mini/run/` reports).
- Ids are sequential within a phase file (`155-1`, `155-2`, …). `add` continues
  after the highest existing index.
- **`reviewed-at` is a baseline, not the reviewed commit.** When `add` runs inside
  a git repo it stamps the finding with the current `HEAD` SHA (shown shortened as
  `@1a2b3c4` in `list`). Because a review runs **between `do` and `done`** — while
  the phase work is still uncommitted — that `HEAD` is the phase's **parent**
  commit: the code state the review *started from*, not the commit of the reviewed
  code (which only exists after `done`). Outside a git repo (or a fresh repo with
  no commit) the field is simply omitted. It lets a later consumer judge whether a
  finding may be stale after the code moved on.
- Open findings surface in [`mini next`](next.md) / [`/mini:next`](../interactive/next.md)
  as candidate **fix phases** (`id · severity · source · where — title`). A phase born from
  one is saved with `--from-finding <id>`, which records the link without closing
  the finding (it stays open until the fix is done and verified). That link lets
  [`mini discuss`](discuss.md) and [`mini plan`](plan.md) read the finding's full
  detail in any later session.
- **A finding gets resolved two ways.** Automatically: when a phase saved with
  `--from-finding <id>` reaches [`mini done`](done.md), that linked finding is
  flipped to `resolved` (and `mini undo` reopens it). Manually: `mini findings
  resolve <id...>` for anything the automatic link doesn't cover — a finding a
  multi-fix phase addressed, or a `nit` you dismiss. `resolve` does **not** record
  *why* it was closed; a resolution `--reason` and a `doctor` orphan-check are
  planned follow-ups.
