# Phase 180 — report from the auto session

## What was done

Fixed should-know 178-2: `stripFindingsSections` (src/state/runReport.ts) scanned
for ATX headings line-by-line with no awareness of fenced code blocks, so a
findings-like `## Adversarial findings` line *inside* a ```` ``` ````/`~~~` block
triggered the stale-section removal, and conversely a real stale section that
contained a fenced `#`/`##` line ended its skip early and leaked its tail.

- Added a `FENCE_LINE` regex (`^[ \t]*(`{3,}|~{3,})`) and a fence-state variable.
  A fence opens on the first delimiter line and closes only on a line of the
  **same delimiter char and at least the opening run length**. While inside a
  fence, ATX headings are treated as literal text — they neither start nor end a
  stale-section skip. This fixes both directions of the finding.
- Translated the function's (and `STALE_FINDINGS_HEADINGS`') Czech JSDoc and
  inline comments to English per the project's English-only rule, and documented
  the deliberate non-goal (no full CommonMark: indented-by-4 fences, fences
  nested in list items — these do not occur in real reports).
- Added two tests to `describe('stripFindingsSections')`: (a) a `## Adversarial
  findings` line inside a ```` ```md ```` block plus the prose after the closing
  fence are kept; (b) a real stale section containing a fenced `# Still inside`
  line is removed in full, with nothing leaking and the following `## Keep`
  section preserved.

## Verification

- `npm run typecheck` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean.
- `runReport.test.ts`: 51 tests passing (incl. the 2 new ones).
- Full suite: 87 files, 1209 tests passing (was 1207).

## Notes / honest limits

- The fence rule is deliberately pragmatic, not a CommonMark parser. Known
  unhandled (and intentionally so) cases: code fences indented by 4+ spaces, and
  fences opened inside a list item. These were judged not to occur in mini run
  reports; documented in the function's JSDoc.
- 178-3 (CorruptPhaseError crashing `mini doctor`) remains open as a separate
  should-know finding — not touched here.
